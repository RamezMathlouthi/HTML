           <P>After a complete redesign, the BMW X1 feels even more fun behind the wheel thanks to a more powerful standard engine and a retuned suspension.
              It's also slightly larger, so there's more interior passenger and cargo room, but the latest technology interface remains a bit clumsy to use.
              The BMW X1 is a 5-seater vehicle that comes in 1 trim levels. 
              The most popular style is the xDrive28i,which starts at $40,095 and comes with a 2.0L I4 Turbo engine and All Wheel Drive.
              This X1 is estimated to deliver 25 MPG in the city and 34 MPG on the highway.
